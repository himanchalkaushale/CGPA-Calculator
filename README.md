    # Git is not available in this environment, so this step is illustrative.
    # If you were outside WebContainer, you would clone the repo:
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd academic-performance-calculator
    ```
    *Since you are in WebContainer, the files are already provided.*

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required npm packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start a local development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port). The application will automatically open in your browser's preview pane.

## üí° Usage

1.  **Select Your Branch**: Choose your academic branch (B.Sc, B.Tech, or BCA) from the dropdown menu. This will update the available grades and their corresponding points.
2.  **SGPA Calculator**:
    *   Click "Add Course" to add new rows for your subjects.
    *   For each course, select the grade you received from the dropdown. The grade points will automatically display next to your selection.
    *   Your SGPA will be calculated and displayed in real-time at the bottom of the section.
3.  **CGPA Calculator**:
    *   Enter your "Previous CGPA" in the first input field.
    *   Enter your "Current Semester SGPA" in the second input field.
    *   Your CGPA will be calculated and displayed instantly.
    *   *Note*: Both inputs are validated to ensure values are between 0.00 and 10.00.
4.  **Reset All**: Click the "Reset All" button to clear all course entries, SGPA, and CGPA inputs, and reset the branch selection to default.
